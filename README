  first, set up github on your computer and make sure you create your local copy of this project in
      your eclipse workspace.
  second, sync this to your new eclipse project folder
  third, you should see this README + AndroidManifest + a single java file down a long directory src/com/ucla... etc
  if you see all that, you are gold!
